# Simple 3D Engine Example

This repository contains a minimal browser based 3D engine example using
[Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for rendering and
[Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/) for physics. The example spawns
several boxes that fall onto a static ground plane.

## Running

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. No build step is required because the
example loads libraries directly from a CDN.
